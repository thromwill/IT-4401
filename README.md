These programs were created throughout this introductory Python class during my first semester sophomore year. Most notable is definitelyNotGuitarHero, a capable Guitar Hero simulator developed over the course of about a week. The other four programs are curated selections of about twenty Python challenges completed during the semester, and are aimed to show the progression of this course.

Projects in order created:

Challenge: Tweet Manager
Challenge: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Final Project: DefinitelyNotGuitarHero
